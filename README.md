# Portfolio Performance Tracker (2015–2025)

This project demonstrates a complete **financial data analysis pipeline** built using Python, Excel, VBA, and Power BI. It analyzes a multi-asset stock portfolio over 10 years and computes key performance metrics such as returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. The final output is a professional, interactive Power BI dashboard.
